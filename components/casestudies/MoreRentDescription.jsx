                My team and I also developed the car listing page which offers a search bar and various filtering options for users to find the perfect vehicle. Additionally, it has a car details page which provides users with detailed information along with suggestions for other recommended vehicles.

                Car owners are also able to list their cars for rent through our Add Car page, while users can easily track their rented and rented-out cars through their profile page.
